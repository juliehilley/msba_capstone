# April 28, 2025 - Week 14
Progress/Problems/Plans: submitted slides and continue wrestling with Looker. All's good.

# April 22, 2025 - Week 13
Progress/Problems/Plans: Presented today to JDC - it went well. Not alot of feedback from the owner, but manager had some questions and comments. Recorded the session which was a little awkward because we were huddled around my laptop.
Continue work on the Looker dashboard - still giving me a few issues. Class presenation tomorrow.
Hours: 12

# April 15, 2025 - Week 12
Progress/Problems/Plans: Was considering moving my presentation up to April 16, but decided to stay with 23rd. Preparing all of my material for next week's JDC/Class presenation. PPT slides are nearly done and Looker dashboard is coming along but is very quirky.
Hours: 12

# April 8, 2025 - Week 11
Progress/Problems/Plans: I've taken feedback from peers re: written and incorporated most of the suggestions - I'm in a good spot with my written - submitted 2nd draft. Modeling is complete and have incorporated into written and have nearly completed the slides. Have been spending nearly all my time in Looker Studio.
It is not the most user-friendly, but being open-source I feel it is a good tool to learn.
Hours: 16

# April 1, 2025 - Week 10
Progress: Built my Prophet and SARIMA models based on 80/20 rule, finding that top 12 categories make up 80% of revenue. Continued modeling and comparing the evaluation metrics on these 12 and have determined a good path forward. Explored/modeled inventory based on sales forecasts.
Continue to develop the written product around the findings of my modleing. Scheduled the stakeholder presentation for April 22, in-class presentation will be April 23 (but, thinking of moving it to 16th).
Also started building out my presentation slides.
Problems/Plans: Trying to work on a plan for a meaningful digital product - the project is static, and I've been aware that JDC doesn't plan to use any kind of digital product going forward. My plan is to mirror my presentation slides and build out a dashboard in Looker Studio.
This is disappointing but reality.
Hours: 20


# March 25, 2025 - Week 9
Progress: As I mentioned earlier, I felt like I was going down rabbit holes with the EDA, but this has been fruitful because it's given me the perspective I need to create a good outline for my written material and establish a clear outline of the project. Finalized the first draft of written and turned in on deadline.
I spend alot of time in my head away from the computer thinking from a 30-thousand foot view. This helps me organize my thoughts to put down on paper. Along with creating a good outline, I started researching the forecast models and have experimented with Prophet and SARIMA. 
Problems: Continue to have difficulty engaging with the stakeholders. They've been away for corporate meetings so when they return I hope to get my presentation on the calendar.
Plans: continue with forecasting sales and inventoy modeling.
Hours: 16

# March 18, 2025 - Week 8
Progress: I spent some time restructuring my github repo. Started work creating my forecasting models and reorganizaing my first draft of written product.
Problems: Not many to report this week. I was out of town for a few days so I have not spent alot of time on my project this week.
Plans: This week I will be spending most of my time building models, writing, and organizing/building my dashboard.
How many hours?: 2 


# March 11, 2025 - Week 7
JDC Shareholder presentation to be scheduled for late April/early May. It might be difficult to get both owners together physically
so I am hoping for the best with this.
I will share my written report and dashboard with the shareholders. Maybe I will contact my old friend Ritchie Sayner
who is an industry leader on retail and inventory management.


# March 4, 2025 - Week 6
Progress: what have you accomplished since last week?
I spent most of my time this week stepping back to re-structure my goals going forward. It felt like I was a little too much in the weeds doing so much EDA without a clear path. Now I have a better path to get me to where I'm going. I clearly set some objectives for a more specific definition of my forecasting strategy. With that, I started visualizing trends, seasonality, and patterns. I created Time Series Plots (overall sales trends over time, seasonal decomposition, category-level sales trends, and YoY comparisons). This was all done on my filtered_retail_sales data. I am now starting to do the same on the filtered_inventory data. Once this is done, then I will begin to build my forecasting models to predict future sales revenue, future inventory levels and demand for specific product categories. The forecast horizon I am aiming to work towards is both a medium term (1-year) and a longer term (2-3 years). I have aggregated my data on monthly as well as quarterly and have also grouped by top 10-12 categories over 5 years and by location. Some features for performing the time series analysis are lag time (creating previous period sales, rolling averages to smooth out patterns of seasonality. I am considering some external variable such as economic data as well since I have discovered a flattening of retail sales over the past 3 years.

Problems: What am I stuck on?
I feel I was stuck before I finally took a step back to get a better perspective and direction for where I was going. With the hickups experienced previously with the owners not being "on board", I have decided to let it be what it is and do the best job that I can with what I have to work with.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week?
I'm planning on meeting the deadline of March 9 turning in my first deliverable, as well as some of what I discussed above in the first section. 

How many hours? 20 or so


# Feb 25, 2025 - Week 5
Progress: What have you accomplished since last week?
Explored the 'inventory' table through various SQL queries and python visualizations. I ultimately created a new table called 'filtered_inventory' based on the timeframe of my sales data. There is alot of aged inventory and it results in skewing the turnover rate so much that I feel like this metric makes this metric irrelevant, but I really need to have a longer discussion for possibilities about how to deal with this. 

Problems: What are you stuck on?
I feel like I'm stuck in the weeds of my datasets. Because I have little to no input from my 'client', I feel a little lost and have a disillusioned outlook on the purpose of this project in terms of what they are/are not invested in. In my opinion, the leadership in this company is struggling with direction and clear goals. This has become apparent not only through my lens regarding my project, but in other areas of the company as well. I'll try my best to stay the course but it has felt quite discouraging. 

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week?
The plan is to create a clear path to  move forward. In terms of the Data Science Process diagram of Problem Framing, Data Acquisition, Data Preparation, Model Planning, Model Building, Visualization/Communication and Deployment Maintenance, I am currently moving into the Model Planning phase so that feels like progress. 

How many hours? 15ish


# February 18, 2025 - Week 4
Progress: What have you accomplished since last week?
Finally was able to have a conversation with the client to determine the 'problem'. I'll be focusing on just the inventory for the stores that are vendor-based categories and have a higher turn than the categories which make up the 'manufacturing' aspects of the business. I received an example of a worksheet that the client fills in manually on a monthly basis and I will focus on replicating this. I have started to parse out the data to focus only on the categories within the data that are relevant to the problem.

Problems: What are you stuck on?
Now that I have more clarity, I'll be able to focus on moving forward. 

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week?
A lot more than I accomplished this past week.

How many hours? 4-6

# February 10, 2025 - Week 3
Progress: What have you accomplished since last week?
All my data files are uploaded to a google cloud storage bucket, and then created/organized my tables in my GBQ project. It took a bit of troubleshooting and making sure all of my files were compatible with GBQ. I've got sales (20-24), inventory, and doorcount tables. I started querying and went down a rabbit hole of discovery. Since I'm working mostly onsite at JDC, I've been able to look up unknown or questionable findings in the POS system, and confirm that the data is sound. I was a little concerned about it at first but everything checks out. I have multiple SQL queries that include Avg Days in Inventory by Category, Category Level Sales Analysis, Inventory Turnover Rate by Category, Margin Analysis Comparison, Profitability Analysis, Sales Trends Seasonality, just to name a few.

Problems: What are you struck on or struggling with?
What I am learning is that the data entry process is a mess and has been since they started using the system. Also, some of the processes for tracking different types of transactions are glaring and skew the data when reporting. For example, they have a process for tracking in-store credit that results in an extremely large error in gross profit margin. If I didn't know this process beforehand, I would have been completely in the dark about what the queries turned up. What has become most apparent at this time is that if they don't correct some of these processes then it will continue to be a problem.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week's post? Since I have spent the bulk of my time so far uncovering the idiosynchrosies of the data with GBQ running SQL queries, I plan to start formulating the business problem so that I can explore modeling in PYthon. The partner who lives in Spokane will be in town a few days this week and I'll spend some time with him examining what I have uncovered so far and have some questions answered so I can proceed.  

How many hours did I spend? About 20-30

# February 3, 2025 - Week 2
Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
1. We determined that working with sales data from 2020-2024 is sufficient. After talking to the client, his feeling about 2019 was that it is irrelevant, stating “we live in a post-covid world”. I will proceed with sales for 5 years for locations 1 & 2, and 1 year + 3 months for location 3. I also pulled an inventory report from the POS. It appears to be everything I need to get started. I’ve been cleaning this csv file to ensure naming conventions are accurate between the sales and inventory variables. 
2. I got a digital version of a book titled, “Forecasting; Principles and Practice” by Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos which I have started reading. They talk about Time Series Regression Models, Exponential Smoothing, and ARIMA models. The book uses R and offers a lot of example code with detailed explanations. 
3. Now that I have data, and it is somewhat clean, my plan is to start with visualizing it this week using various methods explained in the above book.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
1. Honestly I have not yet defined the business problem. I’ve discovered the way in which the inventory is categorized and entered into the POS has been a little haphazard and could present some problems. They currently have 91 categories of inventory, and they have allowed the ability to ‘add’ fields arbitrarily when entering inventory into the system. After doing some EDA and visualization I am hopeful that a more defined problem will present itself. They have many aspects of the business including repair and service, and this alone could offer some possibilities. TBD
2. I had a conversation with the client, and he is acting apprehensive about what I am doing. He stated, “your project is secondary” in the context of priorities. I don’t think he fully understands what the project entails and this could be partially due to not having the business problem defined. 

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
1. I plan on spending the next few days/weeks doing as much EDA and visualization as I can, and to outline a specific problem to solve. 

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post? Between 8-12 hours.


# January 27, 2025 - Week 1
Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I have accomplished the following so far:
1) Extracted most of the data that I will be using for my project with the exception of year 2019 - historical sales and inventory levels.
2) Created a csv file containing the door count/foot traffic data for all three locations of JDC for the relevant years.
3) Interviewed & Shadowed the following: a) Current 'Inventory Manager' at JDC who has been in the position for approx. 9 years and is planning on retiring soon. 
b) Inventory Assistant (who plays an important role because she has been with the company for a long time, but does not fully understand best practices of inventory management
because for so long they have basically 'flown by the seat of their pants'.)
c) Met and Interviewed the second owner/client (Denver Toone) - who will have a more hands-on role in this project.
d) Sat in on 2 separate 'inventory' meetings with company stakeholders, including a consultant who oversees the POS/Analytics software (which is not being utilized to its capacity.)

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
So far I haven't encountered too many problems, but I can foresee problems on the horizon. I haven't recieved all of the data yet, but I feel confident I will get that resolved 
this week. After interviewing many current employees, I do have some fear that the process may become difficult because of 'fear of change'. I have personally been well-received, but there 
are many individuals who have expressed the resistance to change has been very prevalent in the recent past. Overcoming obstacles like this could be very challenging. My plan is to be 
open-minded and respectful of key positions and to present things in a very positive way. After meeting with some key people including the inventory consultant I learned that 60% of
their current on-hand inventory is 'aged' - meaning it is >3 years old, some upwards of 10 years. Their total inventory currently sits north of $11 million. This obviously does not
happen overnight. Inventory turn for this industry is 1x annually. Because the majority of inventory hasn't moved in such a long time, they need to be extremely aggressive in discounting
and implementing other strategies to move. Basically, 40% of their inventory is carrying the business but if we can implement some processes to correct this, they can be very successful.
Right now, it just screams "there is A LOT of work to do!!" 

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I intend to get 100% of the data I'm looking for, and to also connect more deeply with some of the key players who will be able to assist me with this project. I'd like to begin cleaning
the data in order to begin some EDA.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?
So far I have spent roughly 40 hours (or more). I spend 4 full days in Spokane at the headquarters interviewing and shadowing people. Another multitude of hours manually entering 
door counts for 6 years, and many more hours researching, reading, writing and thinking.
